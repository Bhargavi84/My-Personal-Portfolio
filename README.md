# UX
## User story
* Users will know the details about my work, education and experiences and contatct deatils.
* As a owner I can populate all my details for personal portfolio which can be accessed by the recruiters
* User will know complete details about me and will help in hiring me.
* As a new visitor of the website, I want to easily navigate on the page.
* As an interested client, I want to have a contact form easy to fill out.
* As a potential client, I want to get to know Bhargavi's background and personality to see if I want to hire her
* As a recruiter, I would like to get an insight into Bhargavi's work and I also want to have a printable resumé what I can present to my superior.
* As an employer, I visit this page to see a showcase of a potential employee's work.
## 1. Strategy
* Provide a platform where the user can look into my experience for hiring me or any user can use the website for inspirational purpose.
* Provide a platform where user can look into my project work list and share it with other users if they want.
## 2. Scope
* Fits in with my current skill-set of HTML, CSS.
* Easy way to log in into into the website with hire me button for recruiters
* Allow the user to look into Home page, aboutme Download cv, projects and contact page

## 3. Structure
* As the website has two main ideas, Hiring and Project works I kept the website as simple as possible and easy to use. Instead of creating a lot of functionality.

* A part of the home page, every page has the same structure to keep consistency and to make the navigation easy to assimilate.

## 4. Skeleton
### Wireframes
* When I started working on this project, I had a picture of the site in my head. This picture has changed a lot in the last few weeks. 
* I have used Balsamiq for designing the wireframes.
#### Below are the images "My personal portfolio" website would really look almost same.

## 5. Surface
The overall UX is clean and similar in all pages to keep consistency.
* Most part of the website is in Sans sarif font and footer is in Dancing script font.
* I have used Google Fonts to import the fonts for the website.
* Most of the images and background image are from Google images (not copyrighted)
* I have used fontawesome to source all the icons through out the website.
